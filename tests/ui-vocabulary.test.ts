 * What the interface is allowed to say.

 * The collector contract already refuses forbidden metrics as data, and the
 * filter allowlist refuses them as query keys. This is the third place they
 * could still appear: as words on a screen. A label reading "Engagement" over a
 * column of ad counts is the same false claim whether or not a column called
 * engagement exists — the reader believes the label, not the schema.
 *
 * Comments are excluded on purpose. A comment saying why a metric is banned is
 * how the rule survives; only rendered text is the subject here.
